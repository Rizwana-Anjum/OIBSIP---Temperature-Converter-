# 🌡️ Temperature Converter Web App

This is a fully responsive and visually rich **Temperature Converter** web app built as part of my **internship at Oasis InfoByte (Task 3 - Level 1)**.

The entire project is crafted using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — all within a single `.html` file. No frameworks, no external stylesheets or JS libraries — just clean, handcrafted code.
